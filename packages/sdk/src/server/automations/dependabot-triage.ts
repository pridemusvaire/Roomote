Treat a related open PR as in-flight remediation: do not submit duplicate work for alerts it covers, but include it in the scan summary and identify any alerts it does not cover.

If you find actionable candidates, submit up to 3 \`act\` automation work items with \`submit_automation_work_items\`. Do not submit any suggestion work items; they are rejected. Submit at most one work item for each \`targetEnvironmentId\`. Only consider repositories that appear in the "Repository environments" list below. Do not fall back to bare-repo launches. Submit one cohesive remediation bundle for every eligible environment with uncovered actionable alerts, in priority order, until the three-item cap is reached. Do not stop after the single highest-priority bundle when other eligible environments have independent uncovered alerts. For a repository with multiple related lockfile or dependency alerts, create one task that aims to resolve every actionable open alert in that cohesive bundle, not only the first alert inspected. Start with the narrowest security fix that is likely to work, but if the alerts realistically need an aligned lockfile refresh, multiple affected workspaces, or a small related dependency bundle, submit that broader cohesive remediation instead of deferring. Do not turn unrelated alerts into a broad maintenance sweep.

Each submitted act item must:
- target exactly one repository from repository_scope
- copy the matching \`targetEnvironmentId\` from the "Repository environments" list
- include \`executionPrompt\` that starts with \`$update-dependencies\`
- state that success means re-checking the targeted alert bundle and leaving no actionable alerts from that bundle open, unless an existing related PR already covers them
- include investigationContext with the alert URL or number, alert summary, package, ecosystem, manifest path, severity, vulnerable range, first patched version, related open PRs and the alerts they cover, the exact GitHub CLI commands used during triage, and the validation the execution task must perform before opening a PR

Do not post any ${promptContext.surfaceLabel} opening acknowledgement, scan announcement, progress update, or partial finding. After triage reaches a final result, post exactly one concise status message to the configured ${promptContext.surfaceLabel} channel with \`${promptContext.postToolName}\`. State the total number of open Dependabot alerts with a critical/high/medium/low severity breakdown, the per-repository counts, related open PRs (or that none are open), and how many currently open alerts are covered by newly started remediation task(s), existing related PRs, or neither. Keep it manager-readable and do not paste raw GitHub CLI commands, \`gh api\` invocations, or command transcripts. End the task response with a terse internal note after posting the final status.

Treat repository-level gaps such as Dependabot alerts being disabled for a repository, a repository returning zero open alerts, or a repository falling outside configured environment coverage as reportable scan outcomes, not as GitHub setup/auth blockers. If GitHub setup or alert access is blocked, post the same concise status message with the blocker and the counts that could be determined.`;
